# Activity Tracker
Requirements Document

ActivityTraker is a mini social network that makes it really easy for students and parents to track the upcoming activities posted by teachers.

Teachers can sign up and list activities. When adding a activity, they should specify the date/time, location and category of the activity.

A teacher should have a page called My Upcoming Activities. From there, they should be able to edit or remove an existing activity, or add another activity to the list.

Students or parents should be able to view all upcoming activities or search them by teacher, category or location. They should be able to view details of an activity and add it to their calendar.

Additionally, students or parents should be able to follow their favorite teachers. When they follow a teacher, they should see the upcoming activities of their favorite teachers as notifications.
